## `exploratory`

Almost nobody goes into a research project knowing exactly how to solve the problem. The scientific process often requires many attempts at solving a problem, processing a data set, performing a regression, or myriad other ways of thinking about the problem. As a result, one often generates many files of failed approaches before the "correct way" is found. Rather than having these files clutter your desktop or your `analysis` folder, you can put all of those files here.
